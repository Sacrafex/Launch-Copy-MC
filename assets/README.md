# Launch Copy MC Assets

This directory should contain application icons:

- `icon.png` - Main application icon (PNG format, 512x512 recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon (ICO format)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (ICNS format)

You can create these icons from your preferred image editing software or use online converters.

For now, the application will work without these icons, but they will be used when building the application for distribution.
